        <h2>Squibs: A Markdown/LaTeX text editor for tiny academic writing</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Squibs allows you to write a short squib with Markdown and LaTeX and share it on a social media. 
          It is serverless; it saves all data in the URL. (If you lose the URL, you cannot recover your writing.)
          It uses marked.js for Markdown and MathJax for LaTeX. Use \\\\(...\\\\) for inline math and \\\\[...\\\\] for display math.
          It generates a hash-based ID ("Squib ID") for your writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Squibs may be useful when you want to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share a quick note with mathematical expressions on Bluesky and other websites.</li>
          <li>Jot down fugitive dieas and save it in the browser bookmarks.</li>
          <li>Write a tiny paper and instantly publish it.</li>
          <li>Prove you were the first to say it without disclosing the idea while your work is in print or preparation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>
          Write your Markdown note in the text area above (caution: this note will disappear). 
          It will be rendered in this area. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As Squibs saves all your writing as the URL parameters, a long writing may create a URL too long to handle. 
          To make sure your squib can be shared without facing technical limitations (older browers, server-side handling, etc), 
          it is advised to keep the body text under about 1900 characters. X.com imposes strict limits on URL lengths. 
          While a short squib would still fit, X.com appears to be not an ideal platform for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure to know that your data is only saved in the URL. If you lose the URL, you'll lose your work. 
          Post it, bookmark it, email it, or copypaste it. 
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Today, everything is short. Our attention span is not an exception. 
          Some of us may feel reading a paper or a book increasingly challenging. 
          Twitter made blogs short. TikTok made videos short. 
          With Squibs, academic writing can become short as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope Squibs promotes exchanging new ideas by offering a simple way to 
          post an extremely short yet notationally rich piece of writing. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <input class="content" type="text" placeholder="Author" id="author">
      <input class="content" type="text" placeholder="Year" id="year">
      <div id="info" class="content">
        <h4>Squib ID:</h4>
        <span id="hash">ttt</span>
        <h4>What is a Squib ID?</h4>
        <p>
          A SHA-256 hash string is generated from the author name, the year, and the body text. 
          The first twelve letters are used as the Squib ID. As it is derived from a hash string, 
          a Squib ID is an unpredictable, near unique identifier.
          If you change just one letter of your writing, the ID changes, 
          and you cannot predict what ID you're getting before you change the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Posting your Squib ID on social media proves you had the squib at the time of posting, without necessarily posting the squib itself. 
          You may want to consider noting your relevant social medial accounts in the body text before sharing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone cites a squib with its Squib ID in their paper and you refer to a squib of the same title, author, and year, 
          comparing the Squib ID can verify whether the version you're looking at is the same version as the one cited. 
          Make sure to include the Suib Id when citing a squib. 
        </p>
