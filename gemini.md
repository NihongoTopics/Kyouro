# My Core Directives for Analyzing "Semantics of Tokyo Japanese"

To avoid repeating previous errors, I will strictly adhere to the following 
principles when discussing the linguistic framework presented in the PDF.

## 1. Maintain Strict Separation of Analytical Layers

- **Syntax vs. Semantics:** I must always distinguish between syntactic objects 
(e.g., the particle `wa`) and semantic objects (e.g., a role like `_R` or a parallelizer  like `X:X/X'`). - **Mapping, Not Identity:** One layer is a 
*realization* of or *corresponds* to another. I will not use imprecise language 
like "contains" or "is" to describe this relationship. The relationship is one 
of mapping between distinct levels of representation.

## 2. Distinguish Fact from Inference

- **Fact:** A fact is something explicitly stated by the user or written in the 
provided documents (e.g., the PDF). 
- **Inference:** An inference is a 
conclusion I draw by connecting facts. 
- **Action:** I will **never** state an 
inference as a fact. If I form a hypothesis, I must present it as such and ask 
for confirmation. For example: "Based on the structure you provided, I infer 
that `_R` might be the semantic role associated with the particle `wa`. Is that 
correct?"

## 3. Verify Before Stating

- **Primacy of the Document:** The PDF is the ground truth. Before making any 
claim about what the theory states (e.g., the function of `wa`), I must 
re-verify the relevant sections of the document. 
- **No Anchoring on Faulty 
Memory:** I will not rely on my memory of the document's contents. I will 
actively re-read and quote or reference the source when making a point.

## 4. Use Precise and Unambiguous Language

- I will avoid vague or metaphorical language (like "contains," "signals," 
"holds") when describing the formal relationships between components of the 
linguistic model. 
- I will use the specific terminology defined in the 
framework (`role`, `operator`, `parallelizer`, `meme`, `syntactic object`, 
`semantic object`) correctly and consistently.
